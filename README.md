## Flow Control - Challenge
Let's exercise all the content presented in the Flow Control module by coding the following scenario.

The system must receive two parameters via the terminal that will represent two integers, with these two numbers you must obtain the number of interactions (for) and print the incremented numbers in the console (System.out.print), for example:

* If you pass the numbers 12 and 30, we will soon have an interaction (for) with 18 occurrences to print the numbers, for example: "Printing the number 1", "Printing the number 2" and so on.
* If the first parameter is GREATER than the second parameter, you must throw the custom exception called ParametrosInvalidosException with the second message: "The second parameter must be greater than the first"
1. Create the DesafioControleFluxo project
2. Within the project, create the Contador.java class to carry out all the coding of our program.
3. Within the project, create the ParametrosInvalidosException class that will represent the business exception in the system.
